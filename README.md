## Overview
<br/>For this module we were introduces to Tableau, an industry-leading data visualization application. We were supplied with a dataset of bicycle trips from the NYC service CitiBike - a bicycle sharing program based in New York. This dataset contained all the trips taken place in August 2019 and included a breakdown of the users and the trip lengths. We were tasked with analysing the data and presenting our findings using data visualizations built in Tableau.
<br/>We use a variety of visualizations in this module, including bar charts, pie charts and heatmaps. We also saved the story compiled from our worksheets to Tableau public, the link of which can be found above. A detailed discussion of our story follows in the results section.
